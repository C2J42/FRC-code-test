# FRC-code-test - Christian Johnston
This is my submission for the FRC coding skill test.

My solution uses RNG to explore the maze while making a map of dead ends. 
RNG was used in order to prevent the mouse from looping in certain scenarios. 
The mouse is "told" the finish location and it explores the maze semi-randomly while avoiding previously discovered dead ends until it reaches that location.
